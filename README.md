# hello-world

Hello humanity!

This is my first day working with Git and Github.  I've done the whole "Hello World" thing too many times already, but hopefully following this tutorial will bring something new.  I am a learner at heart and need to keep developing my skillset.  Greatest regret?  Not getting started sooner!
